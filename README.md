## Custom Triggers & Extending Functionality

You can add your own triggers or commands to invoke the painting feature in your bot! For example:

### Python (TwitchIO)
- Add another command method to the `PaintingCog` class, or call `self.generate_and_upload_painting(prompt)` from anywhere in your bot code.
- Example:
    ```python
    @commands.command(name="paintme")
    async def paintme_command(self, ctx: commands.Context):
        prompt = f"portrait of {ctx.author.name} as a fantasy hero"
        url = self.generate_and_upload_painting(prompt)
        await ctx.send(f"{ctx.author.name}, here is your painting: {url}")
    ```

### JavaScript (tmi.js)
- Add more message triggers in your `client.on('message', ...)` handler, or call `generateAndUploadPainting(prompt)` from anywhere in your bot logic.
- Example:
    ```js
    if (message.startsWith('!paintme')) {
      const prompt = `portrait of ${username} as a fantasy hero`;
      const imageUrl = await generateAndUploadPainting(prompt);
      client.say(channel, `${username}, here is your painting: ${imageUrl}`);
    }
    ```

Feel free to create new commands, react to chat events, or integrate with other APIs. The painting generation and upload logic is modular and can be reused anywhere in your bot!
